    "This exercise is split into three parts:\n",
    "- In part 1, you will learn the fundamentals of RNNs\n",
    "- In part 2, you will implement a basic RNN yourselves using numpy\n",
    "- In part 3, you will implement an LSTM using pytorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you'll explore recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and some basic natural language processing (NLP). More specifically, your task will be to design an RNN from scratch using only numpy, similar to task 3 in ANN1. The goal of this network is to predict the correct next character given a sequence of characters. This is a simplified version of [causal language modelling](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/language_modeling), which is the main objective that is used to train large language models such as the [GPT series](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/).\n",

If you want to learn more details about RNNs, we recommend [Andrej Karpathy's blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LixFSa7yts) and [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6niqTuYFZLQ)."

    "## What is an RNN?\n",
    "An RNN is a neural network just like the network you designed in ANN1, but with two important distinctions:\n",
    "1) It iteratively produces outputs based on both inputs and previous (recurrent) outputs using shared parameters across time steps\n",
    "2) It employs a \"hidden state\" that is iteratively computed and updated in each forward pass (the hidden state is not a trainable parameter)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence to sequence data\n",
    "RNNs are used mainly for sequential data, i.e. data arranged in sequences where order matters. Typically, this is either time series data, such as weather forecasts or stock markets, or in NLP due to the sequential nature of language. The sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) image below showcases a comprehensive example of ways sequential data can flow through an RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Seq2seq](http://karpathy.github.io/assets/rnn/diags.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The leftmost rectangle is a normal feedforward network without RNNs, e.g. your digit predictor from ANN1. <br>\n",
    "The \"one to many\" rectangle takes one input (non-sequential) and produces a sequence of output, e.g. image captioning which takes one image and produces a sequence of text in response. <br>\n",
    "\"many to one\" is the opposite of image captioning, and can be for instance image generation, where a sequence of text is processed to produce one image. A simpler example is language classification tasks such as sentiment analysis. <br>\n",
    "Finally, there are two examples of \"many to many\". The first example reads the entire input before producing an output, commonly seen in machine translation, where the model reads the whole text in one language to produce a hidden state that represents the latent meaning of the text, then decodes the hidden state to the translated language. The other example of many to many is synced, where each input requires one output in response, such as video frame classification."

    "\n",
    "It's not actually that much different compared to ANN1 if you do it step by step. Starting with the last output, $o_N$ in this case, compute the loss. Then backpropagate from loss to $o_N$, i.e. the derivate of the loss function. Then it is simple to calculate the contribution of $W$ to this loss, i.e. $dL/dW$. This is the contribution of $o_N$ to $W_{grad}$. Save this, but don't update yet! <br>\n",

Howver, you're not quite done yet, as you also want to compute the contribution of the previous hidden state to the loss, i.e. $dL/dh_{prev}$. Save this for next iteration. <br>\n",

    "Note the last derivate you computed, $dL/dh_{prev}$. By solving the partial derivatives you'll find that when computing $dL/dh_{N}$, you relied on the \"fake\" hidden state not yet computed, $dL/dh_{prev}$, which you should initialise to zeros for the first (i.e. last) time step in the backprop. When you compute $dL/dh_{N-1}$ coming from $o_{N-1}$ and $W$, you must include $dL/dh_{prev}$, which this time won't be zero, and corresponds to the backwards movement through time."

This can happen to all networks, but RNNs are far more vulnurable to it due to the long sequences of backprops through time.

    "Now you've seen how RNNs work and implemented a very simple causal language model. If you want to improve it, besides grabbing more data and building bigger models, you could also improve on character-based tokens to n_grams or subwords; make your word embeddings (hidden state) contextual, upgrade your model to a transformer or a state space model, and suddenly you've designed GPT, BERT, T5, LLaMA, or any other \"modern\" large language model. Though RNNs aren't the most popular due to the dominance of the transformer, models such as state space models, which exist inbetween RNNs and transformers, show that much innovation is still possible by merging these two frameworks."
