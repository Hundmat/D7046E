    "# D7046E Exercise 1 (ANN1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise has three taks where you will deepen your understanding of how artificial neural networks (ANNs) are implemented and trained. First, you will represent digits on an eight-segment display as vectors and hard-code perceptrons that classifies the digits. The purpose of this task is to better understand the basic computational units in ANNs and how inputs can be represented as feature vectors. Secondly, you will implement and train neural networks using [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) on the seven-segment display data and the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset which you are familiar with from Exercise 0. Finally, you will implement a neural network including the forward (inference) pass and the backward (learning) pass from scratch using numpy. After completing these steps you will know the central building blocks of ANNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literature\n",
    "Before starting with the implementation you should familiarize yourself with two additional chapters in the [deep learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/). This will help you understand the theory behind neural networks and what mathematical formulas are important for the task. The lectures has touched on most of these concepts. Below is a list of recommended sections from the book. If you feel familiar with the contents of these sections, feel free to skip it.\n",

    "* Chapter 6 - Deep feedforward networks\n",
    "    - Section 6.0 - Discusses what do we mean by feedfoward networks and terminology such as input layer, output layer and hidden layer.\n",
    "    - Section 6.2 - Discusses what gradient based learning is and what cost functions are.\n",
    "    - Section 6.5 - Explains back propagation. Important here are the formulas 6.49 - 6.52.\n",

    "## Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification of seven-segment display numbers with perceptrons. A [seven-segment display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display) can be used to display digits by turning the different segments (A,B,C,D,E,F, G) on or off. Your task is to design ten different perceptrons (which together make a single-layer neural network with 10 outputs) that recognizes the ten different digits (0,1,2,3, ... ,9) represented by a seven-segment display. The input to each perceptron will be a seven-dimensional vector {A,B,C,D,E,F,G} where A is 1 if segment A is turned on and 0 otherwise (and the same for all the other segments).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Seven Segment Display](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/7_Segment_Display_with_Labeled_Segments.svg/225px-7_Segment_Display_with_Labeled_Segments.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that for each digit you should create a vector representing the digit, as well as a perceptron that selectively gives a high output for that particular digit and a low output for other digits. For each digit (0 to 9) the corresponding perceptron shoud have the greatest output value, indicating that it can correctly classify the corresponding digit/vector and thereby distinguish that digit from other digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the digit 2 corresponds to the vector {1,1,0,1,1,0,1}. If the perceptron at index 2 (the third pereptron since we have a perceptron for 0 as well) gives the greatest output for this vector then this perceptron functions as desired. Similarly, other perceptrons should give the highest output for their corresponding vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the digit zero is represented as segments A-F being on and segment G being off. The zero perceptron should reasonably have positive activation for A-F, say at a value of 1, and negative activation for G, say -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why negative?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we instead set the activation for G to 0, then there is no distinction between the digits zero and eight. Thus, our perceptron for zero would have the same output regardless of whether the input is zero or eight. You can address this with biases, so that the output for our eight-perceptron is higher than the zero-perceptron for input eight, and vice versa, but it makes balancing weights and biases much more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good starting point is to consider which activations should be positive or negative, implement this, then check the output for all perceptrons for each digit and then contemplate the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task you should use numpy rather than PyTorch to implement and understand the elementary arithmetic operations involved. After completing this exercise you should understand how an artificial neural network unit (like the perceptron) produces one scalar output from multiple input values, and how the trainable weights and biases determine the relation between input and output values of a neural network unit and layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the input vectors, the weight vectors, and biases. Then update the prediction calculation (forward pass) to include bias in the calculation."

    "### Task 2.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a 2-layer neural network using pytorch as well as a procedure for training and testing it. The training protocol should include both training and validation. Thus you need to split the training data into a training set (for which the error is backpropagated to update the parameters) and a validation set (which will not be used to directly update the model parameters, and instead be used to keep track of how good the model is at unseen data). \n",
    "\n",
    "The weights of the model which performs the best on the validation data should be stored and then be used for the final check on the test set. Validation sets are often created by taking a fraction of the training data (often, but not always, around 20%) at random. In Pytorch you might want to use [random_split](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.random_split) for this. Using random split would require you to edit the way the Dataloaders are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to choose any optimizer and loss function. Just note that some loss functions require the labels to be 1-hot encoded. As you will not use convolutional layers for this exercise (will be introduced later in the course), the inputs need to be transformed to 1d tensors (see [view](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html?highlight=view#torch.Tensor.view)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL:** You should evaluate the network from the epoch with best validation score (early stopping) on the test set aiming to reach at least 85% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember** to run all your code before grading so that the teacher doesn't have to wait around for long training runs. Plot the training and validation losses for each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* Validation and Testing loops are very similar to training except they don't use backpropagation. Additionally testing should only be performed once, while validation should be performed continually to make sure training is proceeding as intended and to save the parameters of the best epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* Storing the best model is more difficult than just assigning it to a variable as this only means you have two variables referencing the same network instance in memory (not a copy of the best betwork and one containing the current network). Instead you ned to make a copy of the network which can be achived with [deepcopy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html). Other ways to store models include saving them as a file which can be done with [torch.save](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* Everytime you train a network with random parameter initialization and random batches you get networks with different performance. Sometimes just running the training again can be enough to get a better result. However, if you do this too many times you run the risk of training (overfitting) on the test set."
